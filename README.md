# tailwindcss-components
The TailwindCSS component view allows you to see both the presentation and the code snippet. Also, the code automatically converts to Handlebars + Context syntax.

Works well in combination with **[BuildY builder.](https://github.com/hinddy/tailwind-builder)** You can simply save the blocks you need by clicking on the "save" button and they will be written to local storage. You can export them in JSON format or just open the builder at the same URL and the blocks will automatically appear in the list of blocks to drag and drop.
